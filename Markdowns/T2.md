# Task T2 â€“ Data Normalization

**Date Completed:** October 27, 2025  
**Hours Spent:** 3  
**Completed by:** Ben Eiler  

### Summary
Implemented logic to standardize mixed betting odds formats into a unified structure.

### Step-by-Step Work
1. Created `normalizeOdds.js` under `backend/src/utils/`.  
2. Developed helper functions to convert between American and Decimal odds.  
3. Rounded values for cleaner presentation and standardized numeric precision.  
4. Tested conversions on sample mock data to ensure accuracy.

### Results
- Odds data now follows a consistent JSON format with `priceDecimal` and `priceAmerican` fields.  
- Simplifies later comparisons and frontend rendering.

### Files Created/Modified
- `backend/src/utils/normalizeOdds.js`
