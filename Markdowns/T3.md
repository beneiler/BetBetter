# T3 – Odds Comparison Logic

## Description
This task implemented backend logic to compare odds across sportsbooks.  
The goal was to identify which sportsbook offered the best line for each event, selection, and market combination. The backend now flags these best values automatically so the frontend can highlight them.

## Implementation
A new module, `compareOdds.js`, was added to the backend.  
It groups odds by event/selection/market, determines the highest odds and tags those records with an `isBest` flag. The main server route `/api/odds` was updated to call this logic after normalization.
