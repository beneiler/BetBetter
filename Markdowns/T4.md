# Task T4 – UI Display of Odds Comparison

**Date Completed:** October 28, 2025  
**Hours Spent:** 3
**Completed by:** Ben Eiler  

### Summary
Built a minimal frontend for BetBetter to visually display and refresh odds data.

### Step-by-Step Work
1. Added `frontend/index.html`, `app.js`, and `styles.css`.  
2. Connected frontend to backend’s `/api/odds` endpoint using Fetch API.  
3. Rendered data in a table highlighting “best” odds rows with color and a star icon.  
4. Included a “Refresh Odds” button to reload data dynamically.  
5. Styled the layout with simple, dark-themed CSS.

### Results
- Frontend successfully displays real-time odds from backend.  
- Provides a clean base for future features like user input or filtering.

### Files Created/Modified
- `frontend/index.html`  
- `frontend/app.js`  
- `frontend/styles.css`
