Description

Connected the new metrics API to the frontend and added a Team Trends section that renders three charts: Rolling Win Rate, OU Hit Rate (OVER), and Streak. I fixed layout stability by hard-capping chart and panel sizes and disabling auto-resize to prevent runaway canvas growth.

Implementation

Updated index.html to add controls (Team ID, window, Load Trends) and three canvases.

Implemented Chart.js rendering in app.js with a fixed-size chart creator (prevents infinite height), plus single-run guards and manual buttons (Refresh Odds, Load Trends).

Styled fixed panels and a scrollable odds table in styles.css to lock layout.
