# T8 – Unit & UX Testing

## Description
This task focused on validating BetBetter’s core backend logic and improving user feedback in the frontend.  
The goal was to introduce automated unit tests for the odds normalization, odds comparison, and team trend aggregation modules, ensuring their accuracy during development.  
Additionally, basic UX error-handling was added to display friendly alerts when API calls fail.

## Implementation
A new `tests` folder was created inside the backend. Using Node’s built-in `assert` library, I wrote test cases for:

1. **normalizeOdds()** – checks that odds formats correctly convert between American and decimal.  
2. **compareOdds()** – confirms that each event’s highest odds line is flagged as `isBest: true`.  
3. **buildTeamTrends()** – ensures team performance data aggregates correctly and returns expected metrics.
