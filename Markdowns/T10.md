Description

Built a lightweight metrics engine to turn raw game history into time-series the UI can chart. The focus was on three backbone stats: rolling win rate, rolling OU hit rate (OVER/UNDER), and signed streak length. I also exposed these via a clean REST endpoint so the frontend can request {teamId, metric, window} and get normalized points back.

Implementation

Implemented a metrics module that:

Normalizes team_history.json (ISO date, win boolean, over/under flag, sorted by date).

Computes:

rollingWinRate(window) → fraction of wins in the last N games.

rollingOUHitRate(window, kind) → hit-rate for OVER/UNDER, skipping pushes/missing.

streakSeries() → positive for win streaks, negative for loss streaks.

Added GET /api/metrics to the Express server with query validation (teamId, metric, window, optional kind).
