# Task T1 â€“ API Data Retrieval

**Date Completed:** October 27, 2025  
**Hours Spent:** 4
**Completed by:** Ben Eiler  

### Summary
Set up the Express backend for the BetBetter project and created an API endpoint to serve mock betting data.

### Step-by-Step Work
1. Initialized a Node.js backend using Express and CORS.  
2. Created a `/api/health` endpoint to verify that the server runs properly.  
3. Added `/api/odds` endpoint to return data from `mock_odds.json`.  
4. Stored mock odds data inside `backend/src/data/mock_odds.json`.  
5. Verified correct JSON output by visiting `http://localhost:3000/api/odds` in the browser.

### Results
- The backend successfully delivers mock odds in JSON format.  
- Confirmed that the frontend can later fetch these results for display.

### Files Created/Modified
- `backend/server.js`  
- `backend/src/data/mock_odds.json`
