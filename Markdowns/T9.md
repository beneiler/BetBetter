# T9 – Data Aggregation for Team Trends

## Description
This task introduced a new backend feature to summarize team performance metrics from historical game data.  
The goal was to analyze results such as wins, losses, over/under outcomes, and spread coverage to calculate overall rates like `winRate`, `overRate`, and `coverRate`.  
These statistics provide the foundation for deeper analytics and future visualization features in BetBetter.

## Implementation
I created a new utility file, `teamTrends.js`, in the backend’s `src/utils` directory.  
This function aggregates data from `team_history.json` by grouping games per team, counting totals, and calculating averages and percentages.
