# T6 – Highlighting UI Component

## Description
After completing the backend comparison logic, this task focused on enhancing the user interface.  
The goal was to make the best sportsbook odds stand out visually while improving the table’s readability and responsiveness across devices.

## Implementation
The `frontend/app.js` file was updated to apply a `.best` CSS class to rows that contain `isBest: true`.  
A helper function formats American odds so positive values show with a “+” sign.  
The `frontend/styles.css` file was completely restyled with a dark theme, hover effects, and mobile responsiveness.  
The Decimal column was removed entirely for a cleaner presentation.
