# Task T15 – Line Movement Testing

## Description
Test data consistency, refresh accuracy, and chart responsiveness.

## Objectives
- Verify time-series data accuracy and consistency
- Test chart rendering with various data scenarios
- Validate refresh mechanisms and real-time updates
- Ensure UI responsiveness under different conditions

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Data Consistency Testing
- Verify timestamp accuracy in stored odds data
- Test data integrity during storage and retrieval
- Validate edge cases (missing data, delayed updates, duplicate entries)
- Confirm proper handling of data gaps

### 2. Refresh Accuracy Testing
- Test scheduled data polling mechanism
- Verify correct timestamp intervals
- Test manual refresh functionality
- Validate data updates without page reload

### 3. Chart Responsiveness Testing
- Test chart rendering performance with large datasets
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- Test interactive features (hover, zoom, selection)
- Validate chart updates when switching props/teams
- Test loading states and error handling

### 4. Integration Testing
- End-to-end test: data collection → storage → retrieval → visualization
- Test concurrent users accessing chart data
- Verify API endpoint performance under load
