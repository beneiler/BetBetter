# T7 – Documentation Updates

## Description
This task focused on improving the project’s overall documentation so that anyone, including an instructor or collaborator, could easily set up, run, and understand BetBetter.  
The goal was to make the repository professional, self-explanatory, and ready for presentation by adding detailed README files and inline code documentation.

## Implementation
I expanded the existing documentation by:
- Updating the **root `README.md`** with project purpose, setup steps, folder structure, and feature descriptions.  
- Creating a **`backend/README.md`** explaining backend endpoints, key files, and setup commands.  
- Adding **JSDoc comments** at the top of `normalizeOdds.js` and `compareOdds.js` to describe their functions, parameters, and outputs.
